# Mastitis App
> ###*Cornell iGem 2016*


## What is iGem?
iGem is a student-run syntehtic biology team. Each year we select a biology problem in our community and devise a solution. This year (2016), we are combatting mastitis, a common and costly disease to dairy farmers nationwide.


## My Role
As part of the ECE/CS subteam, I headed the creation of the Mastits app, which helps farmers manage mastitis on their farms. By consulting local farmers, we hope to build an app that has maximum impact.


## Designs
The *Mastis App* is made up of four sections: a *Somatic Cell Counter*, a *Cost Calculator*, *Cow Data*, and a *CowMD*

### Somatic Cell Counter
> The *Somatic Cell Counter* counts the number of somatic cells and ranks for Mastitis for each milk sample

### Cost Caculator
> The *Cost Calculator* allows farmer to quickly determine if their infected cow is economically viable for their business

### Cow Data
> With *Cow Data* farmers can input their farm's information and recieve a quick analysis of their herd
